However, it&rsquo;s still important to have them inspected periodically to ensure that they are operating at peak efficiency. You should also clean the panels regularly to remove any dirt or debris that may be impacting their performance.</p><h3 id="how-to-troubleshoot-common-issues">How to troubleshoot common issues</h3><p>If you notice that your solar panels are not generating as much energy as they should be, there are a few common issues that could be the cause.
